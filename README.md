# Solovay Kitaev algorithm
This is a C++ implementation of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, a review of which can be found at
[quant-ph/0505030]https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0505030

It has been superseded by all manner of implementations, see for example [here]https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03888, and is available here for historical and pedagogical purposes, as well as proof that I once documented my code.
