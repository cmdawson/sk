# Solovay Kitaev algorithm
This is a C++ implementation of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, a review of which can be found at
[quant-ph/0505030](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0505030)

The field has moved on since this was published (see for example [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03888) or [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2975)). This repo is for historical and pedagogical purposes, as well as proof that I once documented my code.

Two Makefiles are provided, one for Linux/g++ the other for Windows/VC++. 

Check out python/README for info regarding the accompanying python module.

If you have doxygen installed you can run 'doxygen sk.dox' to generate all the documentation, otherwise you can download it from http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/dawson/sk
